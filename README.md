# TravelClaw

OpenClaw meets travel data — an exploration of AI-assisted travel planning and booking.

## Vision

What if your AI assistant could help you plan, book, and manage travel as naturally as asking a friend?

## Research So Far

### Travel APIs

| API | Access | Best For |
|-----|--------|----------|
| **Amadeus** | Self-service, free sandbox | Developers, startups — no approval needed |
| **Skyscanner** | Partner application (>100k monthly traffic required) | Established businesses with traffic |

**Recommendation:** Start with Amadeus for prototyping — free test environment, pay-per-use in production.

### Amadeus Capabilities
- Flight search & booking
- Hotel search & booking
- Airport info & flight status

## Ideas to Explore

- [ ] Natural language flight search ("Find me flights to Barcelona next weekend under £200")
- [ ] Price tracking & alerts
- [ ] Trip planning assistant
- [ ] Multi-city itinerary builder
- [ ] Integration with calendar (block travel days automatically)
- [ ] Packing list generator based on destination & weather

## Next Steps

1. Sign up for Amadeus developer account
2. Build a simple flight search skill
3. Test with real queries
4. Expand from there
